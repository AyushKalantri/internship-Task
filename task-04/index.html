                    <strong> Elon Musk 
                    </strong>
                    <br>EARLY LIFE - Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. His mother is Maye Musk a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada but raised in South Africa. His father is Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and property developer.Elon attended an Anglican Sunday school in his youth.Around age 10, Musk developed an interest in computing and video games and acquired a Commodore VIC-20. He learned computer programming using a manual and, at age 12, sold the code of a BASIC-based video game he created called Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500.
                    </br>
                    <br><br>EDUCATION -
                    Aware that it would be easier to enter the United States from Canada, Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother. While awaiting the documentation, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months; this allowed him to avoid mandatory service in the South African military. Musk arrived in Canada in June 1989, and lived with a second-cousin in Saskatchewan for a year, working odd jobs at a farm and lumber-mill. In 1990, he entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he graduated in 1995 with a Bachelor of Science degree in economics and a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics.
                    In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley during the summer: at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which researched electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and at the Palo Alto-based startup Rocket Science Games. In 1995, he was accepted to a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) program in materials science at Stanford University in California. Musk attempted to get a job at Netscape but never received a response to his inquiries. He dropped out of Stanford after two days, deciding instead to join the Internet boom and launch an Internet startup.

                    <br> BUSINESS - 
                        Zip2,X.com(PayPal) - In 1995, Elon Musk began his career in business by founding a software company called Zip2, which developed an online city guide for popular newspapers. In February 1999, Zip2 was acquired by Compaq, and Musk was generously compensated for his share.
                        Just a month later, he began working on his second company, X.com, which focused on developing an online financial service, incorporating e-mail payment. After a year of business, X.com merged with another similar company, Confinity, which had developed its own online payment service, PayPal. The merged company officially took the name PayPal in 2001.                       
                        PayPal rapidly turned into Musk’s most remarkable success. The company had a quick and steady growth and was acquired by eBay in October 2002. Musk received his share of $165 million dollars, and this gave him the financial independence he needed to pursue more personal goals.

                        SpaceX - With $100 million of his early fortune, Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies Corp., traded as SpaceX, in May 2002. As of 2021, he remains the company's CEO and also holds the title of Chief Engineer. and Musk decided to adopt a different strategy and build rockets instead of buying them. In May 2002, using the money acquired through his previous ventures, he founded SpaceX, originally Space Exploration Technologies, based in Hawthorne, California. Musk is still CEO and CTO of the company.

                        TESLA - Tesla, Inc.originally Tesla Motors was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series A round of funding. Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Musk's involvement. Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004; he invested $6.5 million, became the majority shareholder, and joined Tesla's board of directors as chairman. Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations. Following a series of escalating conflicts in 2007 and the 2008 financial crisis, Eberhard was ousted from the firm. Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008. A 2009 lawsuit settlement with Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder, along with Tarpenning and two others. As of 2019, Elon Musk was the longest tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally. In 2021, Musk nominally changed his title to Technoking while retaining his position as CEO.
                        Tesla first built an electric sports car, the Roadster, in 2008. With sales of about 2,500 vehicles, it was the first serial production all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells. Tesla began delivery of its four-door Model S sedan in 2012; a cross-over, the Model X was launched in 2015. A mass market sedan, the Model 3, was released in 2017. As of March 2020, it is the world's best-selling electric car, with more than 500,000 units delivered. A fifth vehicle, the Model Y crossover, was launched in 2020. The Cybertruck, an all-electric pickup truck, was unveiled in 2019. Under Musk, Tesla has also constructed multiple lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle subassembly factories, such as Gigafactory 1 in Nevada and Gigafactory 3 in China.
